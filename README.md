Overview of my Project:

The language I have used in this is Kotlin and the libraries I have used to fetch the api response is Volley and for the image processing is Glide Library.

1-Firstly to add all the dependencies of libraries in the build.gradle file.

2-All Internet permission in the manifest file.

 

Process:

So, The architecture I have used in MVVM which is Model-view-viewmodel that facilates the development of the graphical user interface from the development of the backened logic such that view is not dependent upon any specific model platform.

I have created a seperated view model and the data model class of the api response.

Designing is done using Material design.

List are done using the recycler view.
